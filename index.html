    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p class="introtext">Welcome to my first website I just tested some of the things I remembered about css. Hope you don't mind.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p class="question" id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p class="answer" id="web-security-answer">First of all I want to state that my answer would depend on the clients knowledge regarding Web and communications Technology. Based on this being a client I would assume their knowledge is non-basic. 
The first advice I would give is to keep everything up to date at all times, especially software and plugins. I would also advice my clients to have easily restorable and secure backup. The last non tech-based advice is to monitor and review the traffic on the website. This is one of the best ways to detect suspicious activity on the browser. I would also show them visual examples of what suspicious activity could be. 
    </p>
    <p class="answer p2" id="web-security-answer">The more tech related advices would include using HTTPS, CSP and WAF. I would advice my client to ensure that their site uses HTTPS and not only HTTP. They should also obtain an SSL/TLS certificate and enforce HTTPS using redirects. CSP or content security policy is something I would advice them to implement. A CSP prevents unauthorized script execution. WAF or Web Application Firewall is recommended to filter traffic and prevent attacks. For more experienced clients I would also include what the firewall does, which is preventing SQL injections and cross site scripting. And last but not least use Strong Passwords and update the passwords periodically. That goes for everything, be up to date and use the best possible software and hardware.</p>
